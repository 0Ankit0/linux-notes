1. **Root Login:**

   - **User:** The "root" user is the superuser or system administrator in a Linux system. It has full access and control over the entire system.
   - **Login:** Root login refers to the act of logging into a Linux system using the root user's credentials (username and password).
   - **Privileges:** When logged in as root, you have unrestricted access to system files, directories, and settings. You can execute any command, modify any file, and make system-wide changes. Root privileges should be used with caution, as they can potentially harm the system if misused.

   **Example of Root Login:**
   ```bash
   # To log in as the root user
   su -
   ```
